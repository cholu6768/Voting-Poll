# Voting-Poll

This script randomizes the votes for 5 candidates from 5 different voting places(schools) and at the end the results are shown.

The inner workings are as it follows:
1. A list with the names of the candidates is created, 5 lists are created which are the 5 different schools and a votes list.
2. Five random votes are inserted in every school list
3. The sum of the votes for every respective candidate is done and inserted in the votes list.
4. At the end, the number of votes with its respective percentage from the total is shown for every candidate.
